# ‚úàÔ∏è charlesfeng.cn ![](https://api.travis-ci.com/CharlesFeng47/charlesfeng.cn.svg)
Personal website running on Gatsby, React, and Node.js, inspired by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia/taniarascia.com) and CI/CD by [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/).

## üß¨ Project Structure

In order to make the structure clearer, I will mark the directories with bold and italics and mark the files with jusr bold.

+ **_content_**: On Tania's original version (However, this part has been migrated to a private submodule, so you cannot seen it anymore. This [link](https://github.com/CharlesFeng47/charlesfeng.cn/tree/872c773f248e1586b12edbbf3dba18798e8fa85c) is my first commit in this repo and it's almost a copy of Tania's version when I started. It contains all the basic info and structures, so I think it might help if you wanna see its original version), there's another folder **_images_** under this folder, and it contains all the images in the posts, but I think, upload all the image files to GitHub is huge and time-wasting when cloning, so I upload image files to my cdn server and quote those in my posts.
  + **_pages_**: My page files, rendering by template [page](https://github.com/CharlesFeng47/charlesfeng.cn/blob/master/src/templates/page.js).
  + **_posts_**: My post files, rendering by template [post](https://github.com/CharlesFeng47/charlesfeng.cn/blob/master/src/templates/post.js).
  + **_thumbnails_**: Thumnnail images of my posts. As you can see what I did to the folder **_images_**, this folder would be removed and the thumbnail images would be transfered to the cdn server in the future.
+ **_data_**
  + **SiteConfig.js**: Some basic info and configurations used to render the website and cited by other components for consistency. For more infomation, you can refer to the detail [configuration](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter#configuration).
  + **projects.js**: Preserving `My Projects` part's info on the website's Index page.
+ **_defaulterror_**: This folder actually has nothing to do with this project. It contains the default 404 error interface on my cdn's root domain [charlesfeng.top](http://charlesfeng.top), and I placed it here to make this error interface could be traced by Git and CI by travis.
+ **_src_**
  + **_components_**: Miscellaneous common components.
    + **Comments.js**: Tania wrote this component for own comment system (For more infomation, you can read [this](https://www.taniarascia.com/add-comments-to-static-site/)), but it's not used right now and I won't use it, thus I just deleted.
    + **Footer.js**: The blog's footer at the bottom.
    + **Navigation.js**: The blog's navigation bar at the top.
    + **PostListing.js**: Display the posts in a list, and it could be set with the props `simple` which means just title and no date. Moreover, When rendering each post in this list, the component would determine whether set the flag on the right by some calculation.
      + Flag 'New': Comparing the date post published and the current date are within specific days. In my setting, it's a week.
      + Flag 'Popular': Examine whether the post's categories contains 'Popular'.
    + **PostTag.js**: Display the post's tags in a list.
    + **ProjectListing.js**: Display the projects in a list, and its data are stored in `/data/projects.js` as mentioned above.
    + **SEO.js**: It's some SEO optimization for search engines.
    + **SimpleListing.js**: Display some info in a list. I don't use this component right now but might use it one day in the future, so I retain this file.
    + **UserInfo.js**: The author's file section at the bottom of the PostTemplate which means it shows at the blog post's bottom.
  + **_context_**: As the folder's name says, it is related to the theme (dark / light).
  + **_fonts_**
  + **_layout_**: The blog's overall structure, including the browser's `Helmet`, `Navigation` at the top, main area at the middle and `Footer` at the bottom.
  + **_pages_**: All components under this folder will be rendered to one specific page regardless of the conditions.
    + **404.js**: Blog's default 404 error interface.
    + **blog.js**: Posts' home interface and the url is `/blog`.
    + **categories.js**: Categories' home interface and the url is `/categories`.
    + **index.js**: Index interface and the url is `/`.
    + **tags.js**: Tags's home interface and the url is `/tags`.
  + **_styles_**
  + **_templates_**: All components under this folder will be rendered to the related page according to the condition, thus each component will be rendered to different pages based on the url. For example üå∞, the component `tag` will be rendered to page `/tags/cdn`, `tags/web`, etc.
    + **category.js**: Category interface and the url started is `/categories/${category}`.
    + **page.js**: Specific page interface and the url started is `/${page-name}`.
    + **post.js**: Specific post interface and the url started is `/${post-slug}`.
    + **tag.js**: Tag interface and the url started is `/tags/${tag}`.
  + **_utils_**: Some common js function.
+ **_static_**: This folder contains a file **robot.txt** and this file will tell the search engines what needs to be crawled and what does not. It's kind of SEO. For more infomation, you can refer to [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard).
