- "**[Expression](http://parclabcn.com)**": _(Mar 2019 - Sep 2019, member)_ The requirements came from "[Dedao University](https://www.igetget.com)" which is a online study platform established by Luo Zhenyu. We achieved to evaluate individuals' expression capability by a constant standard and suggested three input ways, reading, rephrasing and narrating, to meet the voice input needs in a gorgeous way.
- "**MarvelTicket**": _(Spring 2018, leader)_ Based on the requirements of course J2EE, 
  we achieved a ticket management system [frontend](https://github.com/CharlesFeng47/MarvelTicket) which connect the [backend](https://github.com/CharlesFeng47/TicketsManagementSystem) through RESTful api. The frontend is using Vue.js, and the backend was achieved by framework SSH. Then in another course HCI, we transformed the backend to a Springboot project. 
- "**[Quantour](https://github.com/NJUASI/Quantour)**": (Spring 2017, leader) Based on the requirements from college competition, we achived a stock system for review, comparison, and quantification, using the J2EE framework SSH to complete the quantitative backtracking and visual analysis of results.  By decomposing the backtracking function into two steps, forming and sorting, a similar backtracking  function of the [Guorn](https://guorn.com)  is achieved despite of the highly complicated logic, and the consistency and correctness of the results are ensured and proven.
